# Lusha Review 2026: Find B2B Decision-Makers in Seconds, Not Hours

---

So here's the deal. You're a sales rep, a recruiter, or maybe just someone trying to build a pipeline without losing your mind. You've got a list of companies you want to reach. You know the names. You maybe even found them on LinkedIn. But you still can't get a single direct phone number or verified email without spending forty-five minutes going down rabbit holes.

That's the exact problem Lusha was built to solve — and honestly, it does it pretty well.

Lusha started back in 2016 as a simple Chrome extension. The idea was almost stupidly straightforward: let salespeople find real contact info for real people, without digging through ten different websites. Fast forward to now, and it's grown into a full-on AI-powered B2B sales intelligence platform with over 300 million business profiles in its database. It's trusted by more than 2.6 million users, including teams at Google and Zendesk. Not bad for what started as a browser plugin.

## How Lusha Actually Works

The core experience is dead simple. Install the Chrome extension, hop onto someone's LinkedIn profile, and Lusha lights up with their direct phone number and email. One click. Done. No guesswork, no "let me check with the front desk" moment.

But it goes way beyond LinkedIn. The extension works on company websites, industry directories, and even inside your CRM if you're using Salesforce or HubSpot. You're browsing a company's "Team" page at 2pm on a Tuesday and need to reach their VP of Engineering? Lusha can surface that contact right there, in place, no tab-switching required.

For bigger prospecting sessions, Lusha's web platform lets you run searches using advanced filters — job title, seniority, industry, company size, location, technographics (like what tools a company uses), and even buyer intent signals. That last one is where things get interesting. Lusha can flag companies that are actively showing signs of being in-market: hiring momentum, funding news, job changes, tech stack changes. You're not just finding contacts anymore — you're finding *the right moment* to reach them.

## What's Changed in 2026

Lusha has been quietly evolving from "that extension that finds phone numbers" into something more like a full sales intelligence engine. A few things stand out this year:

**AI Recommendations** — Instead of just searching manually, Lusha now analyzes your ideal customer profile and serves up prospect lists automatically. It learns from your past interactions and keeps getting sharper.

**AI Playlists** — Think of these as living, breathing lead lists. They auto-update based on your ICP criteria and real-time signals, so you're always looking at fresh targets without lifting a finger.

**Engage (Email Sequences)** — Lusha added lightweight outbound email automation. You can set up personalized sequences directly inside the platform. It's not going to replace a dedicated sales engagement tool, but for teams that want to keep things consolidated, it's a solid addition.

**MCP Integration** — For teams building more complex AI workflows, Lusha now supports Model Context Protocol, letting other AI tools pull from Lusha's database directly.

## The Chrome Extension: Still the Star of the Show

If there's one thing every single Lusha user agrees on, it's that the extension is fantastic. It's fast, it's clean, and it just works. You don't need a manual, you don't need training — install it and you're finding contacts in about thirty seconds.

The bulk reveal feature on paid plans is a real time-saver too. You can select up to 25 contacts at once from LinkedIn Sales Navigator and reveal all their info in one go. For anyone doing high-volume prospecting, that's not a nice-to-have — it's a necessity.

## CRM & Integrations

Lusha plays well with the tools most sales teams already use:

- **Salesforce** and **HubSpot** (bidirectional sync — reveal data in your CRM and it automatically enriches your records)
- **LinkedIn** and **LinkedIn Sales Navigator**
- **Gmail** and **Outlook**
- **Zoho**, **Pipedrive**, **Microsoft Dynamics**
- **Outreach** and **Salesloft** for sales engagement
- **API access** (available on the Scale plan) for custom integrations

The CRM integration is genuinely smooth. One reviewer from G2 described clicking a LinkedIn profile, revealing the contact through Lusha, and having it land in HubSpot in seconds. That kind of workflow friction reduction adds up fast when you're doing it fifty times a day.

## Lusha Pricing: Breaking It Down Honestly

Here's where it gets a little more nuanced. Lusha uses a **credit-based system**. Every time you reveal an email, that's 1 credit. Every phone number costs 5 credits. So your actual spend depends on what kind of data you're after and how much volume you're doing.

The good news: **annual billing gets you a 25% discount** compared to monthly. That's Lusha's built-in deal — no promo code needed, it's just baked into their pricing structure.

### Plan Comparison

| Plan | Annual Price (per user/mo) | Monthly Price (per user/mo) | Credits | Seats | Key Features |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Free** | $0 | $0 | 40/month | 1 | Browser extension, basic search, email integrations |
| **Pro** | $22.45 | ~$29.85 | 3,000/year | 3 | CSV enrichment (300 rows), AI recommendations, basic analytics |
| **Premium** | $52.45 | ~$69.90 | 7,200/year | 5 | Bulk reveals, advanced analytics, CSV enrichment (500 rows), technographics |
| **Scale** | Custom | Custom | Custom | Unlimited | API, SSO, Customer Success Manager, up to 10,000 CSV rows, full intent data |

### Who Should Pick What

**Free** is genuinely useful for testing the waters. 40 credits a month is enough to run a handful of searches and get a real feel for the data quality before putting any money down. No credit card required.

**Pro** is the sweet spot for solo users or small teams just getting started with outbound. 3,000 annual credits covers a decent amount of prospecting, and the CSV enrichment feature means you can upload an existing list and let Lusha fill in the gaps.

**Premium** is where you go when your team is scaling and you need more firepower — bigger bulk reveals, better analytics, and deeper data access. The jump from Pro to Premium also gets you two more seats.

**Scale** is for the enterprise crowd. If you're running a serious RevOps operation and need API access, custom credit volumes, and a dedicated CSM, this is your lane. You'll need to talk to sales for a quote.

## What Real Users Are Saying

Lusha has **4.3 out of 5 stars on G2** (based on over 1,400 reviews) and **4.0 out of 5 on Capterra** (396 reviews). It made the Capterra Shortlist for Lead Generation in 2025. Here's what actual users are talking about:

**The good stuff:**
- Users consistently praise how fast the extension surfaces contact info, especially direct phone numbers. Several reviewers mention connection rates in the 40–50% range for decision-makers.
- The LinkedIn integration is basically seamless. Multiple reviewers describe it as the thing that makes their daily prospecting actually bearable.
- For the price point, many users — especially recruiters and business development reps — say it delivers solid ROI compared to more expensive alternatives.

**The honest stuff:**
- The credit system can feel tight, especially for high-volume outbound teams. A few reviewers mention running out of credits faster than expected.
- Data accuracy is strong for phone numbers (particularly in the US and EMEA), but email accuracy can be more hit-or-miss. Some catch-all addresses slip through.
- International coverage can be thinner depending on the region. If you're prospecting heavily outside North America and Europe, it's worth testing before committing to a bigger plan.
